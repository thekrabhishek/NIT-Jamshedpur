                        <h1>NO RAGGING</h1>
                    </section>
                    <P>Does the mention of the word ragging give you goose-bumps and make you break into a sweat? Ragging, in NIT jamshedpur, is strictly forbidden. You may be ling a little bit overwhelmed at the prospect of living in a hostel without your parents, but, rest assured, you, just like we did, will meet cheerful and helpful seniors at your hostel’s help desk the day you and your parents arrive. They’ll give a few words of advice to you and your parents, the most important of which will be that ragging is, and has always been, a complete no-no in the institute. In case, you face any problem despite these stringent measures, you are welcome to approach the student Vice President, General Secretary – Welfare, your faculty advisor or your warden at any time for advice or assistance.</P></section>
